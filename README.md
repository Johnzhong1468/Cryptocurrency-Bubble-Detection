# Cryptocurrency-Bubble-Detection
Final Project for Statistics for Financial Engineering, by Chen Zhong, Weijia Chen, Yi Shen, Chen Peng Yuan

Since  the  2000  dot-com  bubble  and  the  2008-2009  financial  crisis,  bubbles  became  an  essential  issue  among  the  financialindustry.  Within  the  past  few  years,  cryptocurrency  emerged  as  a  popular  asset  not  only  among  institutional  investors,  but  alsoamong the retail investors. The problem that we are going to address is to determine in real time whether different cryptocurrenciesexhibit a bubble, which has the characteristic of reaching unrealistic price level and then crashes. Our procedure involves Lassoestimation and using the standard stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion to determine whether the processis a strict local martingale. We will illustrate this bubble detection procedure by applying on the cryptocurrency asset class, wherewe believe price bubbles were widely thought to have existed.
