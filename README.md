# Cryptocurrency-Bubble-Detection
Final Project for Statistics for Financial Engineering, by Chen Zhong, Weijia Chen, Yi Shen, Chen Peng Yuan

Since the 2000 dot-com bubble and the 2008-2009 financial crisis, bubbles became an essential issue among the financial industry. Within  the past few years, cryptocurrency emerged as a popular asset not only among institutional investors, but also among retail investors. The problem that we are going to address is to determine in real time whether different cryptocurrencies exhibit bubble behaviour, which has the characteristic of reaching unrealistic price level and then crashes. Our procedure involves Lasso estimation and using the standard stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion to determine whether the processis a strict local martingale. We will illustrate this bubble detection procedure by apply it to the cryptocurrency asset class, where we believe price bubbles were widely thought to have existed.
